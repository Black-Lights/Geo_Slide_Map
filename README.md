# GIS 2024 - Politecnico di Milano
Repository for the Web Development part of the GIS project 2023 - 2024.

This repository is part of my project for the GIS course I attended at Politecnico di Milano. It is designed for educational purposes and is completely open and available based on open-source software.

All content and code within this repository are provided to facilitate learning and practical application of GIS concepts. Feel free to fork, modify, and enhance this template as much as you wish.

## Installing
Clone the repository using the command 

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Black-Lights/Geo_Slide_Map.git
```
Or fork the repository to have your own copy.

This application uses npm as the package manager and Vite as the web server. It requires Node version 16 or higher.

First, install the dependencies using the command:

```sh
npm install
```
Run the project using the command:

```sh
npm run start
```
This will start a Vite server. Open the application at http://localhost:5173/

Using Vite, it is possible to follow the examples of OpenLayers, as well as use more advanced TypeScript and Visual Studio Code capabilities, such as IntelliSense, fast reload, documentation, and code completion.

Building
Run the command:

```sh
npm run build
```

This will re-create the folder /docs with all the necessary files for hosting the website on GitHub Pages.

Modify the configuration file (vite.config.js) for different build configurations and folder structures.
This is a dummy project and is not intended to be a one-fits-all configuration.

After a somewhat extended break from HTML5 UP (to work on a secret-ish new project --
more on that later!) I'm back with a brand new design: Solid State, a slick new multi-
pager that combines some of the ideas I've played with over at Pixelarity with an "angular"
sort of look. Hope you dig it :)
